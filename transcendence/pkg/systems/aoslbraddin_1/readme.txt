// Installation
// ============================
//
// 1. Backup all your existing /data
// 2. everything within the /scripts directory
//	of this zip, IF you use the POL095
//      Distro release can be copied over.
//	Within the files the sections added
//	are Marked for you to know what to
//	pull out if you use non-distro release
//	of these files. The only parts changed
//	in the Tamed AI are in the mounttype
//	case.
// 3. Add the examples in the npcdesc.cfg that
//	is included. This will give you the
//	majority of ALL the mounts, even the
//	special ones such as the faction steeds,
//	silver steed, sea horse, etc.
// 4. Add the examples in the itemdesc.cfg that
//	is included for the combat package.
//      This will give you the majority of ALL
//      the AOS/LBR special items etc. 
///////////////////////////////////////////
//
//  Email me with any issues, bugs, problems
//  and I can help you fix them or add them
//  to this pkg and update it on the forum
//  "sroyalty@earthlink.net"
//

//
// Additional Notes.....
// ============================
// 1. I did NOT include every single AOS/LBR npc
//	in this release. I did however include a
//	list of all the Graphic entries for them.
//	Please bear in mind, until an issue with
//	core intrinsic weapons is looked into some
//	of the npcs will appear to have missing
//	animations during combat. One fix right
//	now for this is to equip a fencing weapon
//	to the npc and that corrects it.
// 2. While a LOT of the LBR/AOS Items are included
//	in the itemdesc.cfg addon for the combat
//	package, I do not claim to have all of them,
//	or even close. But you will find there is
//	a LOT of them in it, including ALL the AOS
//	weapons added.
// 3. To add the new monsters etc to your own custom
//	npcdesc.cfg entries from the included document
//	on the ID's for LBR and AOS, the objtype can
//	be whatever you really want it to be, however,
//	if you look at the ones supplied you will
//	notice 1 thing different. The entry "Graphic"
//	is present on all of them. That is where you
//	would put in the ID for the npc. Remember,
//	this is ONLY compatible with 3.x and higher
//	clients because they are required to read the
//	.def files in your client install. I strongly
//	recommend fully patching your UO with OSI to
//	be sure they appear correctly to you if you have
//	ANY version of UO (the older ones require the
//	patching in order to see the "converted"
//	graphics, like normal daemons for black gate, etc).
