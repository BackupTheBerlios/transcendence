Removed:
       uo_extend.inc include file requirements in sendevent.src and
       massacre.src.

Added:
       'WhatIsBrain.txt' to the archive. This comes from a post made by
       Birdy on polserver.com, explaining what the brain AI is all about.

Updated:
       Comments at the top of the banker.src listen nerve now points to
       the correct URL where bank.inc is on the pol-script-forum.

       Updated the mongbat.src combat nerve to have instructions for making
       it not require my poison watcher package.

BRAIN.SRC
   Added: NPCs can now have a restart_script setting.
   This will run when POL starts up, and the npc was
   already created, and when RestartScript() is called
   on an npc. 
   
NPC_FLAGS.INC
   Changed: The FlagInfo CProp was renamed to #FlagInfo.

-=[ 6:29PM Apr. 17, 2003 (Austin)]=---------
Added: New include file, NPC_Flags.inc.
       You can now set/read flags on an npc for specific nerves.
       Currently, the only flag used in the brain its self is CONTINUE_ON_SLEEP.

       Functions added to NPC_Flags.inc are
       LoadFlags(mobile)
       SaveFlags(mobile)
       GetFlags(mobile, nerve_name)
       AddFlag(mobile, nerve_name, flag)
       RemoveFlag(mobile, nerve_name, flag)

       NPC_Flags.inc is an extension of NPC_Nerves.inc and
       is automatically included with NPC_Nerves.inc.
       
NPC_FLAGS.INC
  Added: There is now a check in StopNerves() allowing you to
         pass information. If a string is passed called "sleep",
         then it will leave nerves running that have a flag of
         CONTINUE_ON_SLEEP.
         
BRAIN.SRC
  Added: Brain now reads in NerveFlag settings from the npcdesc.cfg.
         Format is NerveFlag NerveName INT //Const Name
         You can redefine multiple flags for a specific nerve.
         
         Example:
              NerveFlag Flee 1 //CONTINUE_ON_SLEEP
              
         To do: Keep existing flag settings, and make them default
                to the config file settings. Too sleepy to implement
                that yet though, sorry!

BRAIN.SRC
  Added: Nerve handling for item given events. 
         Thanks to Birdy for noting I forgot to put that in.

MOVEMENT.INC
  Fixed:
     Movement will only do the distance check when 
     the npc has been told to move toward the object.

  Changed:
     DO-WHILE loops have been turned into REPEAT-UNTIL
     loops to avoid any possible deprecation problems in 096.
  
     SleepMS() statements moved from 10ms to 3ms. This will make
     npcs move more accurately with the new npc.run_speed setting.

     Added priority toggling. Movement sets the priority to 50.
     Once the movement is complete, the priority is returned to
     what it previously was.

MISC
  Changed:
     Include paths now use 095 ecompile.cfg style paths.

BRAIN.SRC
  Added:
     First off, I have seriously commented the brain.src file.
     I think now, even my friend Karen could understand it.

  Changed:
     I have changed Initialize() a bit, so now all the checks
     are dict.exists() instead of dict[key] == error.

     I also changed the check for a "merchant" line, and made
     it "merchant_script". Both merchant events will go to this
     same nerve.

   Fix:
     I have changed line 103 from if ( ev.WakeUp ) to
     if ( ev.WakeUp != NOWAKE). This will make it work
     correctly with core sent events.

MOVEMENT.INC
  Added:
     In MoveLoopCheck() I added a distance check.
     This is only applied for normal NPC movement, and not
     XY movement. This will remove the problem where an npc
     would run in circles around the object until it got a
     new event.

NPC_COMMANDS.INC
  Addded:
     AI_ClearThoughts(mobile, flags) function. 
     This is for 095 only, and will clear the
     event queue for the nerve that calls it and/or to 
     make a nerve clear the brain's event queue. 

     I have beefed up the commenting for this file because
     it is a very important one. I also fixed some comments
     like the one for AI_ForwardEvent().

NPC_EVENT.INC
  Added:
     I have added a comment for NPCEVENT_FWDNERVE.

     I have added three new constants.
     CLR_BRAIN, CLR_NERVE and CLR_BOTH.
     You can use these with the AI_ClearThoughts() function.
     CLR_BOTH is the same as CLR_BRAIN+CLR_NERVE.

  Changed:
     I have changed NETURN_TOWARD and _AWAY to 1 and 2
     instead of 0 and 1.

     I have changed WAKEUP from 1 to 0 and NOWAKE from 0 to 1.
